# Mission

The idea behind creation of this repository is to have next core features when creating a new project:
- Dependencies on which almost every application relies (orientation, localization, navigation, environments .etc)
- Configured TypeScript
- Configured ESLint with strict set of rules and plugins
- Configured testing environment (Storybook, Jest, Detox)
- Set of styles, components and helpers
- Predefined popular scenarios of user behavior (including pages)
- Documentation of before mentioned
- Unification of application/component/style development within teams
- A single code structure

Additionally, to before mentioned concepts, goes documentation of development processes of the way how I and community see it.
It has to be a single source of information in many aspects (e.g. app publishing, splash screen creation, navigation .etc).

I strive to make this as easy as possible using the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) approach whenever possible,
and when there's a case it can't be applied I'll try to document it as good as I can.

There's a lot of "I" in this section, but I'm eager to listen to community and open to new ideas and approaches.

I hope this template will help people with application development.
