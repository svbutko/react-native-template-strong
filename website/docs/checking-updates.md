## React Native Template Strong
You can compare the difference between your version of `react-native-template-strong`
and the current one using `compare` in the [GitHub repository releases](https://github.com/svbutko/react-native-template-strong/releases)

To know on what version of template your app was initially created open `README` file in your local repository, and you'll see `Version`.

When new version of `react-native` or `react-native-navigation` or `typescript` comes, this template will probably follow this and will be updated too as soon as possible.

## Node
Check on `node` and `npm` updates on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install current (latest features) version.

## Brew
Run `brew update` to update [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

After run `brew outdated` to see outdated list of dependencies and if there are some then run `brew upgrade` to keep the latest versions of depedencies like `watchman`, `adoptopenjdk11`, `node`, `fastlane` and many others.

## Node modules
Check on updates of `node_modules` of your own project to keep up with the latest releases by running `npm run check-dependencies-updates`.
Check what's new and update if needed.

## IDEs and Tools
Try to keep your primary IDEs like `Android Studio`, `XCode`, `VSCode`, `WebStorm` and tools like `Flipper`, `Postman` updated too.
