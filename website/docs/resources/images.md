## Before adding images

There are [SF Symbols](./sf-symbols.md) and [Material Vector Icons](./vector-icons.md) included in this project, 
maybe will suit your needs better rather than adding more resources.

## Adding images

To add images, simply put your images into `/resources/images` folder (you can add sub-folders inside there)

And thanks to [react-native-image-resource-generator](https://github.com/svbutko/react-native-image-resource-generator),
run the following script from your `package.json`:

```shell
npm run generate-image-resources
```
It will generate `src/common/ImageResources.g.ts`, and also will fix some of your unacceptable names.

File content will look similar to this:

```typescript
/* eslint-disable */
/* tslint:disable */
import {ImageURISource} from "react-native";

/**
 * This file is auto-generated by react-native-image-resource-generator
 * !!! DO NOT EDIT !!!
 * For more information check the documentation:
 * https://github.com/svbutko/react-native-image-resource-generator
*/

export class ImageResources {
  static readonly camera: ImageURISource = require("../../resources/images/camera.png");
}
```

## Accessing images

To access the images which you added, simply call them the next way:

```typescript jsx
<Image source={ImageResources.camera} style={styles.icon} />
```
