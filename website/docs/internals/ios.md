## Hermes
Enabled

## Versions
Deployment target is set to `13.4`

## Devices
iPhones and iPads are both supported

## Orientations
All orientations are unlocked (locked in React Native by device type)

## Flipper
`Flipper` is disabled in `podfile` due to the fact that it increases app size and goes in production as a pod too,
you can enable it while testing but don't forget to comment it back.
