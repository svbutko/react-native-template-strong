Don't forget to install `JDK 11` because Gradle starts working only from this version.

To do it follow [the next guide](../../troubleshooting#android-gradle-plugin-requires-java-11-to-run-you-are-currently-using-java-18)


## Network security config
There's a network security config which defines next addresses to be allowed:
- localhost
- 10.0.2.2 - Android Emulator
- 10.0.3.2 - Genymotion Emulator

If you have troubles connecting while in debug from physical device, try to add your IP address in `network_security_config.xml`.

## Large heap
Large heap is enabled by default, you can disable it but practice shows that in most of the cases you need to enable it.
