## Before you start

If you are new to React Native, it would be better to learn a bit about it first by
[checking its website](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) and then come back here.

To work with this template you have to install everything what's needed in order to work with React Native,
make sure you have [environment ready to work with](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

## Prerequisites

These are the versions of tools on which this template was created and tested (higher versions should be also supported):

- [Android Studio Flamingo | 2022.2.1 Patch 2](https://developer.android.com/studio)
  - Gradle 7.4.2
  - JDK 11 (Zulu 11)
- [XCode 14.3.1 (14E300c)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
- [Node 20.4.0](https://nodejs.org/)
