## Before you start

If you are new to React Native, it would be better to learn a bit about it first by
[checking its website](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) and then come back here.

To work with this template you have to install everything what's needed in order to work with React Native,
make sure you have [environment ready to work with](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

## Usage

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template react-native-template-strong
```

## After usage

I strongly advise you to be patient, and check documentation to know about all available features.

If you have any questions regarding any particular decision check [FAQ](../faq) 
or [ask a question](https://github.com/svbutko/react-native-template-strong/issues/new/choose) 
or [create a discussion](https://github.com/svbutko/react-native-template-strong/discussions).

If you have any questions you can check the [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting) section.
