## Content

There are some styles that you have to create, but they look the same, to save some time and decrease the amount of unwanted code,
`CommonStyles` were created to solve this problem.

They are located at `/src/core/theme/commonStyles.ts`.

They hold mostly used styles like `flex: 1`, use them like you use any other style.

And add your own styles which are reused around your project a lot.
