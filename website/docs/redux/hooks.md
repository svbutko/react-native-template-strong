## Content

Some hooks which are present in `react-redux` have been modified to utilize local store configuration.

These are the changes that were made:

- `useDispatch` becomes `useAppDispatch`:
```typescript
export const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>();
```

- `useSelector` becomes `useAppSelector`:
```typescript
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;
```

- `createAsyncThunk` becomes `createAppAsyncThunk`:
```typescript
export const createAppAsyncThunk = createAsyncThunk.withTypes<{
    state: RootState;
    dispatch: AppDispatch;
}>();
```
